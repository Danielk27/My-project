      <h3 id="history">A brief history about Japan</h3>
      <p>
        In as early as 1920,<br />
        a discussion revolving around the use of culture and media communication
        was being used as a strategy to enhance the international understanding
        of Japan's perspective was set in place.<br />
        The discussion began when Japan aspired to become an imperial and
        colonial power, one that was equivalent to their Euro-American
        counterparts.<br />
        This idea was interrupted once Japan was defeated in World War II.

      <h3>Japanese culture</h3>
      <p>
        Contemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and
        North America.<br />
        Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware,
        swords, and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and
        rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts,
        calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha, and games.<br />
        Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both
        tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.<br />
        Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List,
        eighteen of which are of cultural significance.Japan is considered a
        cultural superpower.

      <p>
        The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition
        between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.<br />
        The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant:
        <br />
        For example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th
        century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence
        on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on
        post-Impressionism.

      is a 115-acre theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort in Urayasu, Chiba
      Prefecture, Japan, near Tokyo.<br />
      Its main gate is directly adjacent to both Maihama Station and Tokyo
      Disneyland Station.<br />
      It was the first Disney park to be built outside the United States and it
      opened on April 15, 1983.<br />
      The park was constructed by WED Enterprises in the same style as
      Disneyland in California and Magic Kingdom in Florida.<br />
      It is owned by The Oriental Land Company, which licenses intellectual
      property from The Walt Disney Company.<br />
      Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park, Tokyo DisneySea, are the only
      Disney parks in the world not owned or operated by The Walt Disney Company
      in any capacity. The park has seven themed areas: the World Bazaar,
      Adventureland, Westernland, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Critter Country and
      Toontown. Many of these areas mirror those in the original Disneyland as
      they are based on American Disney films and fantasies. Fantasyland
      includes Peter Pan's Flight, Snow White's Scary Adventures, and Dumbo the
      Flying Elephant, based on Disney films and characters.[3] The park is
      noted for its extensive open spaces to accommodate the large crowds that
      visit the park.[2] In 2023, Tokyo Disneyland hosted 15.1 million visitors,
      making it the fourth-most visited theme park in the world and the
      second-most visited theme park in Asia.

      are quite popular in Japan, with Tokyo being home to 58 cat cafés as of
      2015.<br />
      The first was Cat's Store, by Norimasa Hanada, which opened in 2005.
      <br />The popularity of cat cafés in Japan is attributed to many
      apartments forbidding pets, and to cats providing relaxing companionship
      in what may otherwise be a stressful and lonesome urban life.<br />
      Other forms of pet rental, such as rabbit cafés, are also common in Japan.
